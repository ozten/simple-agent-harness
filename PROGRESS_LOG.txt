## Last Session: Configuration loading and CLI argument parsing (simple-agent-harness-utz)

### Completed
- Implemented HarnessConfig::load(path) — loads TOML file, returns defaults if file missing, errors on bad parse
- Implemented HarnessConfig::apply_cli_overrides() — CLI flags override config file values when present
- Added CliOverrides struct for extractable CLI override fields
- Added ConfigError enum with Display + Error impls
- Added Clone derive to all config structs
- Wired up config loading in main.rs: load file → apply CLI overrides → use resolved config
- Enhanced --dry-run to print all resolved configuration values
- Added tempfile dev-dependency for test isolation
- 10 unit tests covering: defaults, TOML loading (empty/partial/full), parse errors, CLI overrides (all/none/partial), full precedence chain
- All tests pass, clippy clean, fmt applied

### Current State
- Config loading is fully functional with correct precedence: CLI > file > defaults
- main.rs loads config and applies overrides before any mode checks
- Stub modules still have dead_code warnings (expected — they're scaffolded but not yet used)

### Suggested Next Tasks
- Implement main runner loop (simple-agent-harness-p0y) — depends on this config work, now unblocked
- Implement signal handling (simple-agent-harness-7rx) — also unblocked
- Implement session spawning (simple-agent-harness-d3v) — also unblocked
