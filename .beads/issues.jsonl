{"id":"simple-agent-harness-ef5m","title":"P0: Clean up temp files when removing worktrees","description":"Temp directories created during agent sessions are not cleaned up, filling the hard drive.\n\n## Problem\n\nWhen agent sessions run, temp files are created (e.g., in `/private/var/folders/` on macOS).\nWhen worktrees are removed, these temp files are NOT cleaned up, accumulating over time.\n\n## Root Cause\n\nThe `worktree::remove()` function only calls `git worktree remove --force`, which removes\nthe worktree directory but not associated temp files created by the agent or blacksmith.\n\n## Portable Solution\n\nRust provides `std::env::temp_dir()` which returns the platform-specific temp directory:\n- macOS: `/private/var/folders/...`\n- Linux: `/tmp/`\n- Windows: `C:\\Users\\...\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\`\n\nWe need to:\n1. Track temp files/dirs created during agent spawn\n2. Clean them up when the worktree is removed\n3. Use portable APIs, not hardcoded paths\n\n## Implementation Options\n\n### Option A: Track temp files in worker state\n```rust\npub struct Worker {\n    // ... existing fields ...\n    temp_files: Vec\u003cPathBuf\u003e,  // Track temp files to clean\n}\n\n// When spawning, if we create temp files:\nworker.temp_files.push(temp_file_path);\n\n// In pool.rs cleanup_worker():\nfor temp_file in \u0026worker.temp_files {\n    let _ = std::fs::remove_file(temp_file);\n    // Also try removing parent if it's a temp dir\n    if let Some(parent) = temp_file.parent() {\n        let _ = std::fs::remove_dir(parent);\n    }\n}\nworker.temp_files.clear();\n```\n\n### Option B: Use tempfile crate properly\nIf using `tempfile::TempDir` or `tempfile::NamedTempFile`, they auto-cleanup on drop.\nEnsure we're not leaking these (keeping them in scope too long).\n\n### Option C: Pattern-based cleanup\nWhen removing a worktree, search temp_dir() for dirs matching patterns:\n- `claude-*`\n- `blacksmith-*`\n- Use creation time heuristics\n\nThis is less reliable but catches leaked temps.\n\n## Investigation Needed\n\n1. Find where temp files are created:\n```bash\nrg \"temp_dir|TempDir|NamedTempFile\" src/\n```\n\n2. Check if spawn_agent_in_worktree creates temps\n3. Check if prompt assembly creates temp files\n4. Check if agent (Claude) creates temps we should clean\n\n## Immediate Workaround\n\nAdd to worktree::remove():\n```rust\npub fn remove(repo_dir: \u0026Path, wt_path: \u0026Path) -\u003e Result\u003c(), WorktreeError\u003e {\n    // ... existing git worktree remove ...\n    \n    // Portable temp cleanup (best-effort)\n    cleanup_temp_files_for_worktree(wt_path)?;\n    \n    Ok(())\n}\n\nfn cleanup_temp_files_for_worktree(wt_path: \u0026Path) -\u003e std::io::Result\u003c()\u003e {\n    // If the worktree path itself is in temp, remove it\n    let temp_root = std::env::temp_dir();\n    if wt_path.starts_with(\u0026temp_root) {\n        if wt_path.exists() {\n            std::fs::remove_dir_all(wt_path)?;\n        }\n    }\n    \n    // Additional pattern-based cleanup can go here\n    Ok(())\n}\n```\n\n## Done When\n\n- [ ] Temp files are cleaned up when worktrees are removed\n- [ ] Uses portable std::env::temp_dir(), not hardcoded paths\n- [ ] Works on macOS, Linux, Windows\n- [ ] Test: create worktree, spawn agent, remove worktree, verify no temp leak\n- [ ] cargo check, cargo test pass\n\naffected: src/worktree.rs, src/pool.rs","status":"closed","priority":0,"issue_type":"bug","owner":"shout@ozten.com","created_at":"2026-02-16T17:13:27.396311Z","created_by":"Austin King","updated_at":"2026-02-16T17:37:43.61842Z","closed_at":"2026-02-16T17:37:43.61842Z","close_reason":"Added portable temp file cleanup to worktree::remove()"}
