## Session: Delete runner.rs (simple-agent-harness-teuq)

### Completed
- Deleted src/runner.rs entirely (dead code after coordinator handles all modes)
- Removed `mod runner;` from src/main.rs
- Removed `use crate::runner;` from src/coordinator.rs
- Moved `format_duration_secs` and `build_progress_string` utility functions into coordinator.rs (they were referenced by coordinator progress printing)
- Moved corresponding tests for those functions into coordinator's test module
- Updated coordinator doc comment to remove runner::RunSummary reference

### Files Changed
- src/runner.rs (deleted)
- src/main.rs (removed mod runner declaration)
- src/coordinator.rs (removed runner import, added estimation import, moved 2 utility functions + tests)

### Current State
- All 1103 tests pass (1 ignored)
- Clippy clean (only pre-existing watchdog.rs warnings)
- Fmt clean
- No remaining references to runner:: in the codebase

### Suggested Next Tasks
- simple-agent-harness-ukxz: Harden customize_prompt_with_llm result handling
- simple-agent-harness-6ugm: Strengthen LLM customization prompt to forbid editing
