## Last Session: Integration Loop Iteration Tracking (2026-02-15)

### What Was Done
- Implemented bead simple-agent-harness-ldy: Add integration loop iteration tracking
- Added `integration_iterations` DB table to schema in `open_or_create` (db.rs)
- Added `IntegrationIteration` struct and three API functions:
  - `record_integration_iterations()` - records iteration count + modules per task
  - `integration_iterations_by_bead()` - query iterations for a specific bead
  - `high_iteration_integrations()` - query tasks exceeding an iteration threshold (for architecture agent)
- Wired recording call into `IntegrationQueue::integrate()` in integrator.rs
  - Records iteration count from circuit breaker + modules involved before reset
- Added 4 tests: insert+query, empty result, zero-count, threshold filtering

### Current State
- All 944 tests pass (1 pre-existing coordinator test failure remains)
- Clippy clean, fmt clean
- The query functions are `#[allow(dead_code)]` since they'll be consumed by the historical signal correlator (simple-agent-harness-4wc)

### Suggested Next Tasks
- simple-agent-harness-4wc (P2): Implement historical signal correlator (now unblocked by this work)
- simple-agent-harness-34d (P3): Add architecture agent configuration knobs
