## Session: Implement POST /api/stop endpoint (simple-agent-harness-oadl)

### Completed
- Added POST /api/stop endpoint to serve API
- Touches the STOP file (from config.shutdown.stop_file) to signal graceful shutdown
- Returns {ok: true} on success, 500 on write failure
- Added stop_file field to AppState, populated from HarnessConfig
- All 1080 tests pass, zero clippy warnings, fmt clean

### Files Changed
- src/serve.rs: Added stop_file to AppState; api_stop handler; POST /api/stop route

### Current State
- Codebase is clean: tests pass, clippy clean, fmt clean
- POST /api/stop writes empty STOP file to trigger graceful shutdown

### Suggested Next Tasks
- Remaining serve API endpoints (simple-agent-harness-3hps, k57l, sqpv, ts82)
