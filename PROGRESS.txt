## Last Session: Implement file resolution from intent concepts (2026-02-16)

### What Was Done
- Implemented bead simple-agent-harness-ikw: file resolution from intent concepts
- Added `resolve()` function to src/file_resolution.rs that maps Layer 1 intent concepts to concrete files and modules
- Core logic:
  - `concept_to_keywords()` — splits concept names like "auth_endpoints" into keywords ["auth", "endpoints"]
  - `keywords_match_name()` — case-insensitive substring matching of keywords against file/module names
  - `resolve()` — scans module names and file stems for keyword matches, collects resolved files/modules per concept
  - `compute_blast_radius()` — BFS on reverse import graph to find transitive dependents
  - `file_relative_path()` — converts absolute paths to src-relative paths for storage
  - `module_detect_name()` — derives module name from directory path
- Skips generic entry points (main.rs, mod.rs, lib.rs) to avoid overly broad matches
- Computes affected_modules (direct matches) and blast_radius (transitive dependents)
- boundary_signatures left empty (populated by public API extractor bead)
- 17 new tests (31 total in file_resolution module): keyword splitting, matching, resolve with file/module matches, compound concepts, blast radius (empty/direct/transitive), no-match, multiple concepts, field passthrough, entry point skipping

### Current State
- Compilation clean (only pre-existing dead_code warnings for not-yet-wired modules)
- Full test suite: 987 passed, 0 failed, 1 ignored
- file_resolution::resolve() is ready for downstream beads (scheduler integration, metadata regeneration)

### Suggested Next Tasks
- simple-agent-harness-ehy (P2): Add public API surface extractor for modules (populates boundary_signatures)
- simple-agent-harness-q5v (P2): Add fan-in hotspot scoring for files
- simple-agent-harness-33k (P2): Add circular dependency detection for modules
- simple-agent-harness-90v (P2): Implement ensure_fresh_metadata for scheduler integration (now unblocked)
