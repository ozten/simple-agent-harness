## Session: Rapid-failure circuit breaker in coordinator (simple-agent-harness-coqa)

### Completed
- Added generic rapid-session failure detection in `src/coordinator.rs` based on zero turns or instant-failure fallback (short duration + low output bytes).
- Added exponential spawn backoff after 5+ consecutive rapid failures using existing `backoff` config settings.
- Added hard pause/alert behavior after 10+ consecutive rapid failures, returning a dedicated `CoordinatorExitReason::RapidFailures`.
- Preserved existing quota-specific detection and shutdown path.
- Added unit tests for rapid-failure detection and backoff threshold behavior.
- Added `## Verify` notes to bead with the commands run.

### Current State
- Coordinator now slows down and eventually pauses during repeated instant failures across any root cause.
- Full release test suite passed in this worktree.

### Suggested Next Task
- Add an integration-style coordinator test that simulates consecutive failed outcomes and asserts backoff/pause behavior across loop iterations.
