## Last Session: Implement worker pool manager (f9m)

### Completed
- Created src/pool.rs with full worker pool manager implementation
- WorkerState enum: Idle, Coding, Completed, Failed with as_str/from_str
- Worker struct tracks: id, state, assignment_id, bead_id, worktree_path, child_handle
- SessionOutcome struct: worker_id, exit_code, duration, output_bytes
- WorkerPool manages up to workers.max concurrent agent sessions:
  - new(): initializes pool with N idle worker slots
  - capacity()/idle_count()/active_count(): pool status queries
  - snapshot(): returns all worker states for monitoring
  - spawn_worker(): assigns bead to idle worker, creates worktree, spawns agent, records in DB
  - poll_completed(): async poll for finished workers (non-blocking via is_finished check)
  - record_outcome(): updates DB assignment status on completion/failure
  - completed_workers(): lists workers ready for integration
  - reset_worker(): cleans up worktree and returns worker to idle
  - active_worktree_paths(): for orphan cleanup
- spawn_agent_in_worktree(): spawns agent process in worktree dir with process_group(0)
- PoolError enum: NoIdleWorker, InvalidWorker, Worktree, Db, Spawn
- Added WorkersConfig to config.rs: max (default 1), base_branch, worktrees_dir
- Registered pool module in main.rs
- 11 new tests covering all functions and edge cases
- All 509 tests pass, clippy clean, fmt clean

### Current State
- pool.rs is ready for use by the scheduler (1ky) and coordinator
- WorkersConfig added to HarnessConfig with serde deserialization support
- DB integration uses existing worker_assignments table from db.rs

### Suggested Next Tasks
- **v6v**: Implement task_manifest.toml parsing (independent P1)
- **1ky**: Implement scheduler for assigning beads to idle workers (now unblocked by f9m)
- **x1a**: Implement session compression with zstd (independent P2)
