## Session: Implement transcript viewer with live SSE (simple-agent-harness-0qvp)

### Completed
- Bead simple-agent-harness-0qvp: Implement transcript viewer with live SSE
- Added TranscriptViewer component in blacksmith-ui/frontend/app.js:
  - Opens as overlay panel from active sessions list via "View Transcript" button
  - Live sessions: connects via EventSource to SSE endpoint, renders turns in real-time
  - Completed sessions: fetches full transcript via REST endpoint
  - Each turn styled by role (assistant=purple, user=green, tool=yellow, system=gray) with left border accent
  - Code blocks rendered in monospace with dark background
  - Client-side text search filters turns and highlights matching text with yellow marks
  - Auto-scroll follows new output, pauses when user scrolls up, toggleable button shows "Following"/"Paused"
  - Close button dismisses overlay, clicking backdrop also closes
- Added SSE proxy endpoint in blacksmith-ui/src/main.rs:
  - GET /api/instances/:url/sessions/:id/stream - proxies SSE from instance (streaming body)
  - GET /api/instances/:url/sessions/:id/transcript - proxies full transcript JSON
  - Refactored stop_instance to use shared resolve_instance_url helper
- Added reqwest "stream" feature to Cargo.toml for bytes_stream support
- Added comprehensive CSS styles in blacksmith-ui/frontend/style.css for transcript overlay/panel/turns/code-blocks/search
- Updated ActiveSessions component to use "View Transcript" button (replacing external link) with onViewTranscript callback
- All 1080 tests pass, zero clippy warnings, fmt clean

### Current State
- Codebase is clean: tests pass, clippy clean, fmt clean
- Transcript viewer works for both live (SSE) and completed (REST) sessions
- Search and auto-scroll features fully functional

### Suggested Next Tasks
- simple-agent-harness-z38u: Implement dependency DAG visualization (P2, ready)
- simple-agent-harness-xc3g: Implement rate limit heatmap (P3, ready)
