## Last Session: Closed already-implemented bead simple-agent-harness-fyx

### What Was Done
- Verified that cycle detection is already fully wired into coordinator scheduling pass
- All requirements from PRD (SPEC-v3-agents.md lines 685-722) are implemented:
  - query_ready_beads() shells out to `bd list --status=open --json` every scheduling pass
  - parse_and_filter_beads() builds dependency graph, runs cycle_detect::detect_cycles(), filters cycled beads
  - format_cycle_path() formats cycle paths as "A -> B -> C -> A"
  - Each cycle logged via tracing::warn! with full path
  - Self-healing: cycles checked every pass, broken cycles auto-recovered
- All related tests passing (parse_and_filter_beads_no_cycles, parse_and_filter_beads_with_cycle, format_cycle_path)

### Current State
- No code changes needed — implementation was complete from prior sessions
- 869 tests total, cycle detection tests all pass

### Suggested Next Tasks
- simple-agent-harness-8iq: Exclude cycled beads from critical path estimation
- simple-agent-harness-cqf: Surface cycle warnings in CLI status output (blocked by fyx + 8iq)
