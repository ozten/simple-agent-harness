## Last Session: Singleton Lock Verification (2026-02-15)

### What Was Done
- Verified that the singleton lock (bead simple-agent-harness-ckq) is fully implemented and working
- The reopening note claiming "fs2 crate missing from Cargo.toml, singleton.rs has unresolved imports, DataDir::lock() doesn't exist" was outdated — all three issues were already resolved
- Implementation verified: src/singleton.rs (try_acquire, PID writing, LockError types, 5 tests)
- Integration verified: main.rs line 1251 acquires lock before coordinator/runner starts
- Dependencies verified: fs2 = "0.4" in Cargo.toml, DataDir::lock() at data_dir.rs:49
- All 5 singleton tests pass, all 9 data_dir tests pass, compilation clean

### Current State
- Singleton lock is functional: prevents concurrent blacksmith instances via flock
- All tests pass (except coordinator test which is a pre-existing known slow test)
- No code changes were needed this session — bead was already complete

### Suggested Next Tasks
- simple-agent-harness-ldy (P2): Add integration loop iteration tracking
- simple-agent-harness-34d (P3): Add architecture agent configuration knobs
