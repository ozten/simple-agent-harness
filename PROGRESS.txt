## Last Session: Implement affected set parsing and glob overlap detection (mjx)

### Completed
- Created src/scheduler.rs with affected-set parsing and glob overlap detection
- parse_affected_set(): extracts glob list from bead design field ("affected: glob1, glob2, ...")
  - Case-insensitive prefix matching
  - Handles whitespace, empty lines, surrounding text
  - Returns None for missing affected set (= "affects everything")
- globs_overlap(): conservative overlap check between two sets of file globs
  - Empty set = affects everything (always overlaps)
  - Uses literal-prefix heuristic: extracts path before first wildcard
  - Two exact paths overlap only if equal
  - Glob vs path: overlap if prefixes are nested
  - Conservative: false positives OK, false negatives not
- 33 new tests covering parsing, overlap detection, prefix extraction, helper functions
- Registered module in main.rs
- All 484 tests pass, clippy clean (only pre-existing dead_code warnings), fmt clean

### Current State
- scheduler.rs is ready for use by the scheduler/worker pool (1ky, f9m)
- Functions are pub for cross-module access
- No external dependencies added (pure string manipulation)

### Suggested Next Tasks
- **1jv**: Implement git worktree lifecycle management (independent P1)
- **v6v**: Implement task_manifest.toml parsing (independent P1)
- **1ky**: Implement scheduler for assigning beads to idle workers (now unblocked by mjx)
