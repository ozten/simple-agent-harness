## Last Session: Implement JSONL event log for external tooling (simple-agent-harness-t0t)

### Completed
- Added `OutputConfig` struct with `event_log: Option<PathBuf>` to config.rs
- Replaced placeholder metrics.rs with full `EventLog` implementation:
  - `SessionEvent` struct with serde Serialize, fields: ts, event, iteration, global, output_bytes, exit_code, duration_secs, committed, retries, rate_limited
  - `EventLog` struct with append-only JSONL writing (open+append+writeln per event)
  - `EventLogError` error type with Display + Error impls
  - `SessionEvent::session_complete()` constructor
- Integrated event log into runner.rs:
  - Creates EventLog from config.output.event_log if configured
  - Emits session_complete event on both Proceed and Skip retry decisions
  - Tracks retries_this_session counter for accurate retry counts
- Updated main.rs dry_run output to display output.event_log setting
- Updated harness.toml with commented-out [output] section
- Updated config tests for new OutputConfig field
- Added 2 runner integration tests: event log creation + no-event-log-when-unconfigured
- Added 6 metrics unit tests for serialization, appending, error handling
- All 87 tests pass, clippy clean, fmt applied

### Current State
- Event log is fully functional: configure `[output] event_log = "harness-events.jsonl"` to enable
- The `committed` and `rate_limited` fields are always false for now (will be populated when commit detection and rate limit features are implemented)
- Pre-existing dead_code warnings remain for unimplemented modules (hooks, retry.current_attempt, session.output_file, watchdog.ProcessExited)

### Suggested Next Tasks
- Implement pre/post-session hook execution (8ff) — P2, unblocked
- Implement prompt prepend_commands (mxg) — P2, unblocked
- Implement rate limit detection with exponential backoff (7d0) — P3, will populate rate_limited field
- Implement commit detection in session output (ee7) — P3, will populate committed field
