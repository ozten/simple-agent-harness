## Session: Pre-spawn worktree bd sync import-only (simple-agent-harness-dd3w)

### Completed
- Added a best-effort `bd sync --import-only` call in `spawn_worker` after worktree selection/creation and before agent process spawn.
- Implemented failure-tolerant behavior: worker spawn now continues if the command exits non-zero or if `bd` cannot be executed, with warning logs in both cases.
- Verified with required gates: `cargo test`, `cargo test --release`, `cargo clippy --fix --allow-dirty`, and `cargo fmt --check`.

### Current State
- Worker startup now attempts to refresh the worktree-local beads SQLite view before each session.
- Existing pool tests continue to pass in environments without initialized `.beads` in test worktrees, confirming spawn remains non-fatal when sync fails.
- Working tree changes are limited to `src/pool.rs`.

### Suggested Next Tasks
- Validate end-to-end in a cantrip run that first-turn agent sessions no longer hit "Database out of sync with JSONL".
- If desired, add a focused unit seam around `run_bd_sync_import_only` for explicit assertion of warning-path behavior.
