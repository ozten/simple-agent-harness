## Session: finish/integrator lifecycle split (simple-agent-harness-hyfd)

### Completed
- Reduced `blacksmith finish` to quality-gate + deliverable verification only in `src/finish.rs`.
- Removed coordinator single-agent direct-close bypass; all completions now use integration path in `src/coordinator.rs`.
- Updated worker pool to always use worktrees even with `workers.max = 1` in `src/pool.rs`.
- Added integrator safety-net commit for uncommitted worker changes, integrated bead metadata commit (`.beads/`), and main-branch push handling in `src/integrator.rs`.
- Added regression test `test_integration_commits_uncommitted_worker_changes`.
- Updated `PROMPT.md` and `templates/PROMPT.md.tmpl` to reflect finish-only verification behavior.
- Updated finish command help text in `src/main.rs`.

### Current State
- Full release test suite passed (`cargo test --release`).
- `cargo clippy --fix --allow-dirty` completed successfully.
- `cargo fmt --check` identified one formatting diff in the new integrator test and that formatting was applied.
- Bead verify notes were added to `simple-agent-harness-hyfd`.

### Suggested Next Task
- Add/adjust integration tests that assert push/metadata-commit behavior when a configured remote exists, so lifecycle ownership coverage includes push semantics explicitly.
