## Last Session: Implement metrics migrate command for V1 data import (simple-agent-harness-j1w)

### Completed
- Added `blacksmith metrics migrate --from <path>` CLI subcommand
- Imports V1 self-improvement.db sessions table into V2 events + observations
- Maps V1 columns to V2 event kinds: assistant_turns->turns.total, narration_turns->turns.narration_only, parallel_turns->turns.parallel, num_tool_calls->turns.tool_calls, input/output/cache tokens, cost_usd->cost.estimate_usd, duration_secs->session.duration_ms (*1000), output_bytes, exit_code
- Imports V1 improvements table, mapping severity->category (critical/high->reliability, medium/normal->workflow, low/minor->code-quality, cost->cost, performance->performance)
- Handles partial V1 schemas gracefully (missing columns default to 0)
- Opens V1 database read-only for safety
- Added 9 new tests covering: not-found, empty V1, full session migration, partial columns, severity mapping, category passthrough, both tables, severity-to-category unit test, no exit_code column
- All 367 tests pass, clippy clean, fmt applied

### Current State
- `metrics migrate` command is fully functional and tested
- V1->V2 migration path is complete for sessions and improvements data

### Suggested Next Tasks
- Implement metrics rebuild command (9cm) — P3, ready
- Implement metrics export, query, and events dump commands (odo) — P3, ready
