## Session: Init copies bundled Claude skills (simple-agent-harness-h9ph)

### Completed
- Added `src/skills.rs` module that embeds 3 Claude Code skills (break-down-issue, prd-to-beads, self-improvement) using `include_str!`
- `install_bundled_skills(project_root)` copies skills to `.claude/skills/` — idempotent, never overwrites existing files
- Updated `blacksmith init` handler in `src/main.rs` to call `install_bundled_skills` after data dir initialization
- Skills are embedded at compile time from `.claude/skills/*/SKILL.md`

### Files Changed
- src/skills.rs (new): Bundled skills module with `BUNDLED_SKILLS` const and `install_bundled_skills()` function, plus 2 tests
- src/main.rs (modified): Added `mod skills;` declaration and skill installation call in Init handler

### Current State
- All 1082 tests pass (+1 ignored), zero clippy warnings, formatting clean
- 2 new tests: test_install_creates_skills, test_install_is_idempotent

### Suggested Next Tasks
- Init: auto-detect project type and populate PROMPT.md verification section (simple-agent-harness-10qw)
