## Last Session: Recover Orphaned in_progress Beads (2026-02-15)

### What Was Done
- Verified bead simple-agent-harness-9ob was already fully implemented
- `recover_orphaned_beads()` in coordinator.rs:462 queries `bd list --status=in_progress --json` and resets orphaned beads to open
- Called at coordinator startup (line 115), after singleton lock guarantees no other coordinator is running
- 5 unit tests for the parser + 1 integration test for graceful failure all pass
- All 27 coordinator tests pass

### Current State
- Compilation clean (only pre-existing dead_code warnings in expansion_event/file_resolution/intent/import_graph modules)
- All coordinator tests pass

### Suggested Next Tasks
- simple-agent-harness-4a1 (P1): Add codebase import graph parser
- simple-agent-harness-34d (P3): Add architecture agent configuration knobs
