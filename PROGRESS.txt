## Session 178: Scaffold serve subcommand with feature gate and health endpoint

### Completed
- Bead simple-agent-harness-72hv: Scaffold serve subcommand
- Added axum + tower-http as optional deps behind `serve` Cargo feature flag
- Created src/serve.rs with axum router and GET /api/health endpoint returning {"ok":true}
- Added Serve variant to CLI Commands enum with --port and --bind args
- Added ServeConfig to config.rs with port (default 8420) and bind (default 0.0.0.0)
- CORS headers configured via CorsLayer::permissive()
- `cargo build` without features does NOT pull in axum (verified via cargo tree)
- `cargo build --features serve` compiles cleanly
- All 1077 tests pass, zero clippy warnings

### Current State
- Codebase is clean: tests pass, clippy clean, fmt clean
- The serve feature is fully gated behind `--features serve`
- 7 beads are now unblocked by this work (72hv was the bottleneck)

### Suggested Next Tasks
- simple-agent-harness-srg0: Create blacksmith-ui workspace crate (P1, ready)
- simple-agent-harness-9b6v: Implement project and status API endpoints (P1, now unblocked)
- simple-agent-harness-i7t0: Implement UDP multicast heartbeat (P2, now unblocked)
