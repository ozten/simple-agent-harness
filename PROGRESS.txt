## Completed: simple-agent-harness-u81

Updated defaults/PROMPT.md to replace all 7 occurrences of `bd-finish.sh` / `./bd-finish.sh` with `blacksmith finish`. This migrates the embedded prompt for deployed (non-dogfooding) mode to use the new Rust-native finish subcommand.

Root PROMPT.md was intentionally left unchanged — it still references `bd-finish.sh` for backwards compat during the dogfooding transition.

## Current state
- defaults/PROMPT.md: 7 references to `blacksmith finish`, 0 references to `bd-finish`
- Root PROMPT.md: unchanged, still uses `bd-finish.sh`
- All 1171 tests pass
- cargo check, clippy, fmt all clean

## Suggested next tasks
- Continue Milestone 2 migration work (any remaining beads that update prompts/configs for deployed mode)
