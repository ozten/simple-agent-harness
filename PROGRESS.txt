## Last Session: Filed Milestone 8b beads (Dependency Cycle Detection)

### Status
- Created 4 beads from SPEC-v3-agents.md Milestone 8b (Dependency Cycle Detection)
- All beads have descriptions referencing PRD line numbers
- Dependency graph wired: core algorithm -> coordinator wiring + estimation -> CLI surface

### Beads Created
- simple-agent-harness-9xv: Implement cycle detection algorithms (Kahn's + Tarjan's SCC) in cycle_detect.rs [READY]
- simple-agent-harness-fyx: Wire cycle detection into coordinator scheduling pass [blocked by 9xv]
- simple-agent-harness-8iq: Exclude cycled beads from critical path estimation [blocked by 9xv]
- simple-agent-harness-cqf: Surface cycle warnings in CLI status output [blocked by 9xv, fyx, 8iq]

### Suggested Next Tasks
- Pick up simple-agent-harness-9xv (core algorithms) — it's the only ready bead
- After that, fyx and 8iq can be done in parallel
- Consider filing beads from automated-architecture-and-metadata.md PRD after cycle detection is complete
