## Session: Implement UDP multicast heartbeat (simple-agent-harness-i7t0)

### Completed
- Bead simple-agent-harness-i7t0: Implement UDP multicast heartbeat
- Added socket2 v0.5 as optional dep behind `serve` Cargo feature flag
- Extended ServeConfig with heartbeat (bool), heartbeat_address (String), api_advertise (Option<String>)
- Implemented heartbeat_loop in serve.rs: spawns a tokio background task that sends JSON UDP multicast every 30s
- Heartbeat payload includes: v (version), project (from cwd), api (bound addr), status, workers_active, workers_max, iteration, max_iterations, pid
- api_advertise config allows NAT override of the advertised API URL
- heartbeat=false in config suppresses heartbeat entirely
- Multiple instances can coexist on same machine (SO_REUSEADDR + non-blocking socket)
- Also fixed 2 pre-existing test failures in config::tests (quality gates defaults expected "cargo check" but actual default was "cargo check --release")
- All 1080 tests pass, zero clippy warnings, fmt clean

### Current State
- Codebase is clean: tests pass, clippy clean, fmt clean
- Heartbeat feature is fully gated behind `--features serve`
- k5z6 (instance discovery) is now unblocked by this work

### Suggested Next Tasks
- simple-agent-harness-k5z6: Implement instance discovery and registry (P1, now unblocked)
- simple-agent-harness-fsnv: Implement serve port auto-allocation (P2, ready)
- simple-agent-harness-xi2k: Add estimate API endpoint (P2, ready)
