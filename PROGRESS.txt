## Last Session: Implement main runner loop orchestration (simple-agent-harness-p0y)

### Completed
- Implemented runner.rs with full iteration loop:
  - `run()`: async main loop that coordinates all modules
  - `run_session_with_watchdog()`: spawns child process, runs watchdog + force-kill signal handler concurrently via tokio::select!
  - `load_counter()` / `save_counter()`: persistent global iteration counter (reads/writes plain text file)
  - `read_prompt()`: reads prompt file for session input
  - `StopFileStatusExt` trait for ergonomic STOP file checks
- Loop flow: check STOP file → check signals → read prompt → spawn session + watchdog → evaluate retry policy → update counters → inter-iteration delay
- Watchdog integration: runs concurrently with child via tokio::select!, kills stale sessions
- Signal integration: registers child PID for force-kill, checks shutdown between iterations
- Retry integration: evaluates output size, retries empty sessions with delay, skips after exhausting retries
- Consecutive error safety: breaks after 5 consecutive spawn/IO failures to prevent infinite loops
- Exit code 124 convention for watchdog-killed sessions
- RunSummary + ExitReason returned to main for final output
- Wired runner into main.rs: installs SignalHandler, calls runner::run(), prints summary
- 13 new tests (6 unit + 7 integration):
  - test_load_counter_nonexistent, _valid, _with_whitespace, _invalid
  - test_save_counter, test_save_and_load_roundtrip
  - test_run_three_productive_iterations: verifies 3 iterations with echo, output files created, counter persisted
  - test_run_stops_on_stop_file: STOP file prevents any iterations
  - test_run_stops_on_signal: pre-set shutdown flag stops loop
  - test_run_fails_on_missing_prompt: missing prompt file exits with PromptError
  - test_run_retries_empty_sessions: verifies retry + skip behavior with 'true' command
  - test_run_resumes_from_existing_counter: continues from persisted counter value
  - test_run_with_single_iteration: single iteration works correctly
- All 61 tests pass, clippy clean, fmt applied

### Current State
- Core MVP loop is functional — can run N productive iterations with configurable agent
- STOP file, SIGINT/SIGTERM, watchdog, and retry all integrated
- Unblocks: status file (3dl), hooks (8ff), event log (t0t), rate limit detection (7d0), commit detection (ee7)

### Suggested Next Tasks
- Implement structured console logging with tracing (yyb) — P2, unblocked
- Implement pre/post-session hook execution (8ff) — P2, now unblocked by runner
- Implement status file with atomic JSON writes (3dl) — P2, now unblocked by runner
