## Last Session: Verify import graph parser (2026-02-15)

### What Was Done
- Verified bead simple-agent-harness-4a1 (Add codebase import graph parser) was already fully implemented
- src/import_graph.rs exists with complete implementation: build_import_graph(), parse_use_crate(), parse_mod_declaration(), resolve_module_path(), resolve_mod_declaration()
- Module already declared in main.rs (line 15)
- 22 unit tests all pass covering: empty project, single file, use crate::, mod declarations, subdirectories, pub use re-exports, nested paths, comments, deduplication, group imports, glob imports, parse helpers, nonexistent imports
- Full test suite: 959 passed, 0 failed
- Applied cargo fmt fix in config.rs (pre-existing formatting issue)

### Current State
- Compilation clean (only pre-existing dead_code warnings in expansion_event/file_resolution/intent modules)
- All 959 tests pass
- import_graph module is ready for use by downstream beads (cycle detection, fan-in analysis, etc.)

### Suggested Next Tasks
- simple-agent-harness-75u (P1): Add module boundary detection from file tree (blocked by 4a1, now unblocked)
- simple-agent-harness-ikw (P1): Implement file resolution from intent concepts (blocked by 4a1, now unblocked)
- simple-agent-harness-33k (P2): Add circular dependency detection for modules
- simple-agent-harness-34d (P3): Add architecture agent configuration knobs
