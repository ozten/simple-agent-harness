## Session: Prevent zero-turn session ID burn (simple-agent-harness-fpj4)

### Completed
- Changed worker output staging to write attempts under `sessions/failed/attempt-<worker>-<id>.jsonl` instead of consuming numbered session IDs at spawn.
- Added `WorkerPool::allocate_session_id()` and moved real session ID consumption to coordinator completion handling.
- Updated coordinator completion flow to:
  - detect useful sessions via adapter `turns.total` extraction,
  - promote useful outputs to `sessions/<id>.jsonl`, persist counter, and ingest metrics,
  - keep zero-turn attempts in failed-attempt logs without consuming session IDs.
- Added/updated tests in `src/pool.rs` for staged output behavior and explicit session ID allocation.
- Added `## Verify` notes to bead `simple-agent-harness-fpj4`.

### Current State
- Zero-turn attempts no longer consume global session IDs.
- Failed attempts are still logged for debugging in a separate failed-attempt namespace.
- Metrics ingestion now occurs only for promoted sessions with useful turns.

### Suggested Next Task
- Add a coordinator unit/integration test that exercises promotion/non-promotion paths end-to-end and asserts counter persistence behavior.
