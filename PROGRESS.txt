## Last Session: Add coordinator SQLite tables for multi-agent state (zl7)

### Completed
- Added 4 coordinator tables to db.rs open_or_create migration:
  - worker_assignments: tracks worker-to-bead assignments with status, affected_globs JSON, timestamps, failure_notes
  - task_file_changes: records which files each assignment modified (added/modified/deleted)
  - integration_log: tracks merge history with manifest entries, cross-task imports, reconciliation flag
  - bead_metrics: per-bead cumulative metrics (sessions, wall_time, turns, tokens, integration_time)
- Added indexes: worker_assignments(status, bead_id), task_file_changes(assignment_id), integration_log(assignment_id)
- Added CRUD functions for all 4 tables:
  - insert_worker_assignment, update_worker_assignment_status, get_worker_assignment, worker_assignments_by_status
  - insert_task_file_change, file_changes_by_assignment
  - insert_integration_log, integration_log_by_assignment
  - upsert_bead_metrics (with ON CONFLICT upsert), get_bead_metrics, all_bead_metrics
- Added comprehensive tests for all new tables and functions (22 new tests)
- All 451 tests pass, clippy clean, fmt clean

### Current State
- Coordinator tables are ready for use by worker pool manager (f9m) and session-to-bead attribution (dgh)
- Schema matches SPEC-v3-agents.md lines 669-713 exactly
- Dead code warnings expected since no consumers exist yet (blocked tasks f9m, dgh)

### Suggested Next Tasks
- **f9m**: Implement worker pool manager (now unblocked by zl7)
- **dgh**: Implement session-to-bead attribution (now unblocked by zl7)
- **mjx**: Implement affected set parsing and glob overlap detection (independent P1)
- **1jv**: Implement git worktree lifecycle management (independent P1)
