## Last Session: Wire cargo check gate in bd-finish.sh (2026-02-16)

### What Was Done
- Implemented bead simple-agent-harness-m6l (P0): Post-session cargo check gate
- Added step 0 to bd-finish.sh that runs `cargo check` before any staging/committing/closing
- If cargo check fails, the script aborts with exit 1 and prints clear error message
- This prevents agents from closing beads when the code doesn't compile
- Addresses the Session 50 incident where singleton.rs P0 was closed despite not compiling

### Current State
- Codebase compiles cleanly (only pre-existing dead_code warnings for not-yet-wired modules)
- All 1123 tests pass
- bd-finish.sh now has cargo check as a mandatory gate before bead closure

### Suggested Next Tasks
- simple-agent-harness-5hg (P1): Enable 3 parallel agents (was blocked by this bead, now unblocked)
- simple-agent-harness-56j (P1): Add improvement recording to agent PROMPT.md workflow
- simple-agent-harness-cgo (P2): Add refactor proposal generation from architecture analysis
