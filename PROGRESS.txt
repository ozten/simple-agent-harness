## Last Session: Implement config validation with helpful error messages (simple-agent-harness-edb)

### Completed
- Added `HarnessConfig::validate()` method that checks all config fields and returns actionable error messages
- Validates: prompt_file exists, output_dir exists/creatable, agent.command in PATH, timeout values > 0, max_iterations > 0, initial_delay <= max_delay, commit_detection patterns compile, extraction rules compile, target rules have valid compare/direction values, pct_of requires relative_to
- Added `command_in_path()` helper that searches PATH directories for the agent binary
- Integrated validation call in main.rs after config load + CLI overrides, before dry_run or main loop
- Removed redundant per-field extraction rule validation from dry_run path (now handled by validate())
- Added 17 new tests covering all validation paths
- All 358 tests pass, clippy clean (pre-existing dead_code warnings only), fmt applied

### Current State
- Config validation runs on every startup, producing clear error messages like:
  `session.prompt_file: file 'missing.md' does not exist`
  `agent.command: binary 'nonexistent' not found in PATH`
  `backoff.initial_delay_secs (1000) must not exceed backoff.max_delay_secs (100)`
- Validation errors are collected (not fail-fast), so users see all issues at once

### Suggested Next Tasks
- Implement metrics migrate command for V1 data import (j1w) — P3, ready
- Implement metrics rebuild command (9cm) — P3, ready
- Implement metrics export, query, and events dump commands (odo) — P3, ready
