## Session: Close beads after successful multi-agent integration (simple-agent-harness-x761)

### Completed
- Updated `IntegrationQueue::integrate()` to close the bead in bd immediately after a successful fast-forward merge to main.
- Added `close_bead_in_bd()` in `src/integrator.rs`:
  - Runs `bd close <bead-id> --reason "integrated <bead-id> at <merge-commit>"` for traceability
  - Runs `bd sync` after a successful close
  - Logs warnings on failures without failing integration
- Kept integration behavior non-fatal if bead-closing commands fail.

### Verification Run
- `cargo test` (pass)
- `cargo test --release` (pass)
- `cargo check` (pass)
- `cargo clippy --fix --allow-dirty` (pass)
- `cargo fmt --check` initially reported formatting diff; code was corrected to rustfmt style.

### Current State
- Multi-agent integrations now attempt to close beads in bd after successful merge, enabling closed-count progress visibility and dependency unblocking in bd.

### Suggested Next Task
- Validate behavior in a live coordinator run (manual cantrip scenario) to confirm progress lines increment per integration and dependent beads unblock as expected.
