## Session: Adaptive heartbeat timing (simple-agent-harness-7qtr)

### Completed
- Changed heartbeat from fixed 30s interval to adaptive: 2s burst for first 30s, then 10s settled
- New instances now discoverable in ~2-4s instead of ~50s
- Updated log message to reflect new behavior

### Files Changed
- src/serve.rs: heartbeat_loop now uses BURST_INTERVAL (2s), SETTLED_INTERVAL (10s), BURST_DURATION (30s) constants with tokio::time::Instant to determine interval

### Current State
- All 1080 tests pass, zero clippy warnings, formatting clean
- Simple, contained change in heartbeat_loop function

### Suggested Next Tasks
- Adaptive backend polling (simple-agent-harness-uurh) - complementary feature for UI side
- Frontend poll interval/SSE push (simple-agent-harness-v2j0)
