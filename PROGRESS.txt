## Session: Implement project detail view in frontend (simple-agent-harness-k760)

### Completed
- Bead simple-agent-harness-k760: Implement project detail view in frontend
- Added ProjectDetail component in blacksmith-ui/frontend/app.js that fetches /api/instances/:url/poll-data
- StatusBar section: shows online/offline status, iteration count (with max), worker count, uptime
- BeadList section: renders beads from poll data with status filter tabs (all/open/in_progress/closed), click-to-expand details showing type, priority, assignee, description
- ActiveSessions section: shows worker assignments with ID, status, bead assignment, duration, transcript link
- MetricsSummary section: displays avg cost, tokens, duration, turns, cost today, beads closed today in a grid
- StopButton section: confirmation dialog pattern, POSTs to /api/instances/:url/stop proxy endpoint
- Added /api/instances/:url/stop proxy endpoint in blacksmith-ui/src/main.rs that forwards POST to the instance's /api/stop
- App component now shows ProjectDetail when a project is selected (replaces overview), shows overview when no project selected
- Added comprehensive CSS styles in blacksmith-ui/frontend/style.css for all 5 detail sections
- All 1080 tests pass, zero clippy warnings, fmt clean

### Current State
- Codebase is clean: tests pass, clippy clean, fmt clean
- Project detail view has all 5 required sections: status bar, bead list, active sessions, metrics summary, stop button
- Data auto-refreshes at 10s poll interval via useEffect
- Stop button proxied through dashboard backend to instance /api/stop
