## Session: Scaffold embedded frontend with project list sidebar (simple-agent-harness-g7hg)

### Completed
- Bead simple-agent-harness-g7hg: Scaffold embedded frontend with project list sidebar
- Added rust-embed and mime_guess dependencies to blacksmith-ui/Cargo.toml
- Created blacksmith-ui/frontend/index.html: minimal HTML shell loading app.js + style.css
- Created blacksmith-ui/frontend/app.js: Preact + HTM (no build step) application with:
  - Sidebar component showing project list with status dots (green=online, gray=offline)
  - Worker count display per project
  - Click-to-select with visual highlight
  - Add Project form with URL input, name input, error handling
  - Aggregate overview cards (open beads, in progress, workers, instances online, cost today)
  - Auto-refresh every 10 seconds via polling /api/instances and /api/aggregate
- Created blacksmith-ui/frontend/style.css: dark theme dashboard styles, 280px sidebar, responsive cards
- Modified blacksmith-ui/src/main.rs:
  - Added rust-embed FrontendAssets struct embedding frontend/ directory
  - Added static_handler fallback route serving embedded files with correct MIME types
  - SPA fallback: non-file paths serve index.html
- All 1080 tests pass, zero clippy warnings, fmt clean

### Current State
- Codebase is clean: tests pass, clippy clean, fmt clean
- Opening http://localhost:8080 serves the embedded dashboard
- Frontend uses CDN-loaded Preact+HTM (no build step needed)
- Frontend assets are compiled into the binary via rust-embed

### Suggested Next Tasks
- simple-agent-harness-k760: Implement project detail view in frontend (P2, unblocked by this)
- simple-agent-harness-9t4l: Implement cost and performance trend charts (P2, unblocked by this)
- simple-agent-harness-vs6h: Implement worker timeline visualization (P2, unblocked by this)
