## Last Session: Implement configurable target thresholds and metrics targets command (simple-agent-harness-obm)

### Completed
- Added `MetricsTargetsConfig` and `TargetRule` structs to `config.rs`
  - Each rule: kind, compare (pct_of/pct_sessions/avg), relative_to, threshold, direction (above/below), label, unit
  - Nested under `[metrics.targets.rules]` in blacksmith.toml
- Added `Targets` subcommand to `MetricsAction` enum in `main.rs`
  - Accepts `--last N` flag (default 10) for window size
  - Loads config to pass target rules to handler
- Implemented `handle_targets` in `metrics_cmd.rs`
  - Loads recent observations, parses JSON data
  - Evaluates each rule: avg (average over sessions), pct_of (ratio of two metrics), pct_sessions (% sessions with event present)
  - Direction-aware comparison: "above" = good when >= threshold, "below" = good when <= threshold
  - Formatted output with unit-aware display ($, %, raw) and OK/MISS status
  - Summary line: "All N target(s) met" or "X/N target(s) met, Y missed"
- Added 17 new tests (318 total pass): evaluate_target for avg/pct_of/pct_sessions/no_data/unknown_mode, format_target_line with $/%/miss, full handle_targets with DB for pass/fail/empty/mixed cases, TOML config parsing
- Clippy clean, fmt applied

### Current State
- `blacksmith metrics targets` command fully functional
- Target rules are purely config-driven — add TOML, no code changes needed
- Pre-existing dead_code warnings remain for functions consumed by future features
- The `evaluate_target` and `format_target_line` functions are internal to metrics_cmd.rs

### Suggested Next Tasks
- Add target miss warnings and streak detection to brief output (h97) — P2, was blocked by obm (now unblocked)
- Implement --dry-run mode (5x6) — P3, ready
- Implement --quiet mode for minimal output (r43) — P3, ready
