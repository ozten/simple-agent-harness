## Session: Update prd-to-beads skill to use defer/undefer pattern (simple-agent-harness-ar6v)

### Completed
- Updated step 4 to pass `--defer=+2h` to every `bd create` call so coordinator can't grab beads during drafting
- Added new step 6 "Validate and undefer" that runs `bd lint` then `bd undefer` on all created bead IDs
- Renumbered "Output summary" from step 6 to step 7
- All existing guidelines and template sections preserved

### Files Changed
- .claude/skills/prd-to-beads/SKILL.md (modified)

### Current State
- All 1117 tests pass
- Zero clippy warnings, formatting clean

### Suggested Next Tasks
- Pick up ready beads: simple-agent-harness-dwng (fix DEFAULT_CONFIG), simple-agent-harness-6in9 (preflight check module)
