## Last Session: Implement task_manifest.toml parsing and manifest application (v6v)

### Completed
- Created src/task_manifest.rs with full parsing and application logic
- TaskManifest struct: parses task_manifest.toml with serde/toml
- Sections supported:
  - [[lib_rs_additions]]: mod_declaration and reexport kinds, appended to lib.rs (falls back to main.rs)
  - [[cargo_toml_additions]]: dependency and dev_dependency kinds, merged into Cargo.toml [dependencies]/[dev-dependencies]
  - [[mod_rs_additions]]: targeted append to any mod.rs file
  - [[ts_index_additions]]: targeted append to any TypeScript index.ts barrel file
- parse(path) and parse_str(content) for file and string-based parsing
- apply(manifest, root) applies all entries to a worktree, returns count of entries applied
- All operations are idempotent (skip if line already exists / dep already present)
- ManifestError enum: Io, Parse, CargoTomlParse
- Registered module in main.rs
- 15 new tests covering: parsing, invalid kinds, all apply types, idempotency, fallbacks, error cases
- All 524 tests pass, clippy clean, fmt clean

### Current State
- task_manifest.rs is ready for use by the integrator module
- Follows spec from SPEC-v3-agents.md lines 511-569

### Suggested Next Tasks
- **1ky**: Implement scheduler for assigning beads to idle workers (P1)
- **x1a**: Implement session compression with zstd (P2)
- **e2l**: Implement raw adapter with pass-through extraction (P2)
