## Last Session: PRD Decomposition (2026-02-15)

### What Was Done
- Decomposed PRD (prd/automated-architecture-and-metadata.md) into 24 beads with full dependency wiring
- Three major areas covered: Two-Phase Task Metadata, Automated Architecture Agent, Migration Maps
- All beads have descriptions referencing specific PRD sections

### Current State
- 24 new open beads, 5 ready to work (no blockers)
- Ready beads: 4a1 (import graph parser, P1), 5f1 (intent data model, P1), 0lk (file resolution model, P1), ldy (integration loop tracking, P2), 34d (config knobs, P3)
- Dependency graph fans out from 3 roots: import graph parser, intent model, file resolution model

### Suggested Next Tasks
- Start with P1 ready beads: 4a1 (import graph parser), 5f1 (intent data model), 0lk (file resolution model)
- These unlock the most downstream work
- 4a1 is the highest-value starting point — it unblocks 7 direct dependents
