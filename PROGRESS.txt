## Last Session: Fix session file naming for parallel workers (2026-02-16)

### What Was Done
- Fixed bead simple-agent-harness-82c (P0): Worker output files now use numeric `{N}.jsonl` naming
- Changed `pool.rs` to use a `next_session_id` counter instead of `worker-{id}-{bead_id}.jsonl` naming
- The counter is initialized from the global iteration counter file (`data_dir.counter()`) in `coordinator.rs`
- Counter is persisted back to the counter file after each successful spawn
- No changes needed to compress.rs, retention.rs, gc.rs, or metrics_cmd.rs — their existing numeric parsers now correctly find worker output files
- Added `test_session_files_use_numeric_naming` test verifying the fix
- All 1124 tests pass, clippy and fmt clean

### Files Changed
- `src/pool.rs`: Added `next_session_id` field to `WorkerPool`, updated `new()` to accept initial counter, changed `spawn_worker` to use numeric naming, added `next_session_id()` getter, added new test
- `src/coordinator.rs`: Added `load_counter`/`save_counter` helper functions, loads counter on startup and saves after each spawn, updated all test call sites

### Current State
- Worker session files now follow the same `{N}.jsonl` convention as serial mode
- Compress, retention/gc, and metrics subsystems will correctly discover and process parallel worker output files
- Counter is shared between serial runner (runner.rs) and parallel coordinator (coordinator.rs) via the same counter file

### Suggested Next Tasks
- simple-agent-harness-cgo (P2): Add refactor proposal generation from architecture analysis
- simple-agent-harness-83g (P3): Add migration map generation for refactor tasks
- simple-agent-harness-34d (P3): Add architecture agent configuration knobs
