## Last Session: Add SQLite dependency and create database module with improvements table (simple-agent-harness-sxy)

### Completed
- Added `rusqlite` v0.31 with `bundled` feature to Cargo.toml
- Created `src/db.rs` module with:
  - `open_or_create(path)` function that opens/creates SQLite database at given path
  - Improvements table schema per PRD: id, ref, created, resolved, category, status, title, body, context, tags, meta
  - Indexes on status and category columns
  - WAL journal mode enabled for better concurrent read performance
  - `next_ref(conn)` function for auto-increment ref assignment (R1, R2, ...)
- Added `mod db` to `src/main.rs`
- 13 comprehensive tests covering: creation, idempotency, insert/query, defaults, timestamps, uniqueness, ref generation, all columns, index usage, persistence
- All 171 tests pass (158 existing + 13 new), clippy clean, fmt applied

### Current State
- Database module is ready but not yet wired into the runner loop
- Pre-existing dead_code warnings remain for unimplemented features (metrics.path, retry.current_attempt, etc.)
- The db::open_or_create and db::next_ref are pub but currently show dead_code warnings since nothing calls them yet

### Suggested Next Tasks
- Create events and observations tables in database module (cl6) — P1, now unblocked
- Implement improve add and improve list CLI subcommands (evl) — P1, now unblocked
