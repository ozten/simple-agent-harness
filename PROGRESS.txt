## Last Session: PRD-to-beads decomposition of SPEC-v3-agents.md

### Completed
- Decomposed SPEC-v3-agents.md (Milestones 5-9) into 37 beads with full dependency graph
- Milestone 5 (Data Directory & Lifecycle): 6 beads (ib1, 1u6, x1a, 503, wck, jkn)
- Milestone 6 (Agent Adapters): 6 beads (wi2, e2l, 6hk, 9jw, ee2, zb5)
- Milestone 7 (Prompt Delivery & Additional Adapters): 6 beads (tzx, hxq, ec1, y74, 2su, hhv)
- Milestone 8 (Multi-Agent Coordinator & Worktrees): 9 beads (zl7, mjx, 1jv, f9m, 1ky, d2q, wdo, 3mu, dgh)
- Milestone 9 (Integration Loop, Reconciliation & Time Estimation): 10 beads (3pa, v6v, m5l, yg5, 3su, 7ed, dfe, ml7, 506, c37)
- All dependencies wired: 30 blocked, 7 ready to work

### Current State
- 37 open beads, 7 ready (no blockers):
  1. [P1] ib1: Add storage config and .blacksmith/ directory initialization
  2. [P1] wi2: Define AgentAdapter trait and extract Claude adapter
  3. [P1] zl7: Add coordinator SQLite tables for multi-agent state
  4. [P1] mjx: Implement affected set parsing and glob overlap detection
  5. [P1] v6v: Implement task_manifest.toml parsing and manifest application
  6. [P2] tzx: Implement prompt_via config with arg/stdin/file delivery modes
  7. [P2] hxq: Add agent.coding and agent.integration config sections

### Suggested Next Tasks
- Start with ib1 (storage config) — it unblocks 4 downstream beads (1u6, x1a, jkn, 1jv)
- wi2 (AgentAdapter trait) can be done in parallel — it unblocks 7 downstream beads
- zl7 (coordinator tables) can also start in parallel — it unblocks f9m, dgh
