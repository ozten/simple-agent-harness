## Completed: simple-agent-harness-ea2 — Wire self-improvement promotion cycle into coordinator

### What was done
Implemented three features for the self-improvement feedback loop:

1. **Coordinator injects open improvements into agent prompt**: The coordinator now uses `prompt::assemble()` (which calls `brief::generate_brief()`) to build a base prompt that includes performance feedback, target warnings, and open improvements from the DB. Each worker gets this base prompt plus a bead-specific suffix. Previously the coordinator only sent "Work on bead: {id}" as the prompt.

2. **Promoted improvements written to PROMPT.md**: When an improvement is auto-promoted, `append_promoted_to_prompt()` appends it to the configured prompt file with an HTML comment noting the source ref ID and category, plus the improvement body (or title as fallback) as a bullet point.

3. **Auto-promotion after configurable session count**: New `[improvements]` config section with:
   - `auto_promote_after` (default: 5) — number of successful sessions after creation before auto-promoting
   - `prompt_file` (default: "PROMPT.md") — where to append promoted rules
   - Set `auto_promote_after = 0` to disable
   - Promotion runs after each successful integration at multiples of `auto_promote_after`

### Files changed
- `src/config.rs` (modified — added `ImprovementsConfig` struct with tests)
- `src/coordinator.rs` (modified — added prompt assembly, auto-promotion logic, tests)
- `src/runner.rs` (modified — added `improvements` field to test config)

### Current state
- All 1178 tests pass
- `cargo check`, `cargo clippy`, `cargo fmt --check` all clean

### Suggested next tasks
- Consider adding auto-promotion to the serial runner path as well (currently only coordinator)
- Add `blacksmith improve` CLI subcommand to view/manage promotion history
