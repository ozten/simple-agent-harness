## Last Session: Add quantitative metrics summary to brief command output (simple-agent-harness-pcb)

### Completed
- Extended `generate_brief()` in `brief.rs` to include a `## PERFORMANCE FEEDBACK (auto-generated)` section
- Queries the most recent observation from the database via `db::recent_observations(conn, 1)`
- Parses the observation's JSON data field and formats metrics: turns, narration %, parallel %, cost, duration
- Performance feedback section appears before the OPEN IMPROVEMENTS section
- Output matches PRD format: "Last session #N:" followed by metric lines
- Brief still works correctly when only improvements exist (no observations) or only observations (no improvements)
- Added 8 new tests for performance feedback (277 total tests pass)
- Clippy clean, fmt applied

### Current State
- Brief command now outputs both performance feedback and improvements
- Target comparison (OK/MISS) not yet implemented — depends on configurable targets (obm bead)
- Pre-existing dead_code warnings remain for functions consumed by future features

### Suggested Next Tasks
- Implement configurable extraction rules from TOML config (i9s) — P2, ready
- Implement configurable target thresholds and metrics targets command (obm) — P2, ready
- Add target miss warnings and streak detection to brief output (h97) — P2, blocked by obm
