## Session: Stale worker status cleanup (simple-agent-harness-yz95)

### Completed
- Updated `blacksmith workers status` to self-heal stale active assignments.
- Added filtering against current open bead IDs from `bd list --status=open --json`.
- Added reap behavior: active DB rows for non-open beads are marked `integrated` and excluded from status output.
- Added unit tests for bead-id JSON parsing and stale assignment reaping behavior.
- Added `## Verify` notes to the bead with exact validation commands.

### Current State
- `workers status` now shows only assignments tied to open beads when `bd` is available.
- Historical assignment rows are preserved (status transitioned to `integrated` rather than deleted).
- All required quality gates passed: release tests, clippy fix, and fmt check.

### Suggested Next Task
- Validate in a real multi-worker run that stale entries are automatically reaped from older DB state when `workers status` is invoked.
