## Session: E2E smoke test for blacksmith-ui (simple-agent-harness-949)

### Completed
- Created `scripts/smoke-test-ui.sh` — automated smoke test that:
  - Starts `blacksmith serve` on a test port (18420) against a real project
  - Validates all serve API endpoints return HTTP 200
  - Checks JSON payload fields (health.ok, project.name)
  - Tests session/transcript/stream endpoints if sessions exist
  - Starts `blacksmith-ui` with a temporary config pointing at the serve instance
  - Validates all dashboard API endpoints including proxied transcript routes
  - Reports PASS/FAIL summary with failure signatures
  - Clean teardown of both processes on exit
- Updated `docs/dashboard.md` with Smoke Testing section documenting:
  - Quick start commands
  - What each phase checks
  - How to detect regressions
  - Expected output format
  - Failure signature table
- Updated `docs/troubleshooting.md` with Dashboard Smoke Test Failures section

### Files Changed
- scripts/smoke-test-ui.sh (new)
- docs/dashboard.md (added Smoke Testing section)
- docs/troubleshooting.md (added Dashboard Smoke Test Failures section)

### Current State
- All 1096 tests pass
- Zero clippy warnings, formatting clean

### Suggested Next Tasks
- Run the smoke test against cantrip to validate it works end-to-end
- Consider adding the smoke test to CI once infrastructure supports it
