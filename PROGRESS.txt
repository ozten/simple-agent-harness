## Last Session: Implemented cycle detection algorithms (simple-agent-harness-9xv)

### What Was Done
- Created src/cycle_detect.rs with detect_cycles() function
- Phase 1: Kahn's algorithm (BFS topological sort) identifies nodes in cycles
- Phase 2: Tarjan's SCC decomposes remaining nodes into individual strongly connected components
- Reuses BeadNode from estimation.rs
- Returns Vec<Vec<String>> of sorted cycle groups (deterministic output)
- Handles: self-loops, multi-node cycles, external deps, mixed DAG+cycle graphs
- 11 comprehensive unit tests all passing
- Registered module in main.rs

### Current State
- 865 tests passing, no clippy errors, code formatted
- dead_code warnings expected (detect_cycles not yet called from production code)
- Next beads (fyx, 8iq) are now unblocked

### Suggested Next Tasks
- simple-agent-harness-fyx: Wire cycle detection into coordinator scheduling pass
- simple-agent-harness-8iq: Exclude cycled beads from critical path estimation
- Both can be done in parallel after this bead closes
- simple-agent-harness-cqf: CLI surface (blocked by fyx + 8iq)
