## Session: Resolve shared repo-level .blacksmith path in git worktrees (simple-agent-harness-1d04)

### Completed
- Verified the existing `src/main.rs` path-resolution logic matches this bead’s requirements for shared repo-level `.blacksmith` behavior in git worktrees.
- Confirmed and executed deterministic tests for shared default behavior and non-default config override behavior.
- Ran all required verification and quality gates successfully.

### Current State
- No additional code edits were needed this session; implementation and tests were already present and passing.
- Verification completed: targeted tests, full `cargo test --release`, `cargo clippy --fix --allow-dirty`, and `cargo fmt --check`.

### Suggested Next Task
- Start the next highest-priority ready bead: `simple-agent-harness-c34r` (`blacksmith progress` add/list/show).
