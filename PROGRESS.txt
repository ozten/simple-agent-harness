## Session: Implement global metrics aggregation (simple-agent-harness-p4um)

### Completed
- Bead simple-agent-harness-p4um: Implement global metrics aggregation
- Added GlobalMetrics and SessionOutcomes structs to blacksmith-ui/src/poller.rs
- Extended MetricsSummary deserialization to include cost_this_week, beads_closed_today, session_outcomes
- Added compute_global_metrics() function that aggregates across all polled instances
- GlobalMetrics stored in PollDataStore alongside existing Aggregate, recomputed each poll cycle
- Added /api/global-metrics endpoint in blacksmith-ui/src/main.rs
- Added GlobalMetricsPanel component in blacksmith-ui/frontend/app.js:
  - Displays cost today/this week, beads velocity (/day), worker utilization (% with progress bar)
  - Stacked bar chart for session outcomes (success/failed/timed out) with legend
- Added global metrics CSS styles in blacksmith-ui/frontend/style.css:
  - Grid layout, progress bar, stacked bar chart, outcome legend with color dots
- App component fetches /api/global-metrics alongside existing endpoints
- All 1080 tests pass, zero clippy warnings, fmt clean

### Current State
- Codebase is clean: tests pass, clippy clean, fmt clean
- /api/global-metrics endpoint returns JSON with total_cost_today, total_cost_this_week, beads_velocity, worker_utilization, workers_active, workers_max, outcomes
- Frontend renders the GlobalMetricsPanel in the main content area between AggregateCards and project detail

### Suggested Next Tasks
- simple-agent-harness-fsnv: Implement serve port auto-allocation (P2, unblocked)
- simple-agent-harness-k760: Implement project detail view in frontend (P2, unblocked)
- simple-agent-harness-z38u: Implement dependency DAG visualization (P2, unblocked)
