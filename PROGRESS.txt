## Last Session: Implement blacksmith metrics beads per-bead timing report (c37)

### Completed
- Added `blacksmith metrics beads` CLI subcommand
- Added `Beads` variant to `MetricsAction` enum in `src/main.rs`
- Added match arm wiring to call `metrics_cmd::handle_beads()`
- Implemented `handle_beads()` in `src/metrics_cmd.rs`:
  - Queries all bead_metrics from the database
  - Displays a table with columns: BEAD, STATUS, SESSIONS, WALL TIME, TURNS
  - Shows totals: X closed (Ym), Z open
  - Shows averages: Xm/bead, Y turns/bead (over completed beads)
  - Shows fastest and slowest completed beads
  - Shows overall totals: sessions, wall time, turns
- Added `truncate_bead_id()` helper for display truncation
- 8 new tests (beads report + truncation tests)
- All 854 tests passing

### Key Files Modified
- `src/metrics_cmd.rs` — handle_beads + truncate_bead_id + 8 tests
- `src/main.rs` — MetricsAction::Beads variant + match arm
