## Last Session: Add metadata drift detection between regenerations (2026-02-16)

### What Was Done
- Implemented bead simple-agent-harness-buv: metadata drift detection
- Added to src/metadata_regen.rs:
  - `DEFAULT_DRIFT_THRESHOLD` constant (3.0x)
  - `ConceptDrift` struct: tracks per-concept file count changes
  - `DriftReport` struct: full drift analysis with `has_drift()` and `summary()` methods
  - `detect_drift()`: compares latest cached resolution against new resolution, flags concepts where resolved file count grew by >= threshold (configurable, default 3x)
  - `count_unique_files()`: helper to count deduplicated files across mappings
  - 12 new tests covering: no previous resolution, same-entry skip, below/above/at threshold, 0→N drift, new concepts, custom threshold, multiple concepts mixed, summary formatting

### Current State
- Compilation clean (only pre-existing dead_code warnings for not-yet-wired modules)
- Full test suite: 1100 passed, 0 failed, 1 ignored
- Drift detection ready to be called after any `ensure_fresh()` regeneration

### Suggested Next Tasks
- simple-agent-harness-a9n (P2): Implement structural metrics aggregator for architecture analysis
- simple-agent-harness-4wc (P2): Implement historical signal correlator (was blocked by buv, now unblocked)
- Wire detect_drift into regenerate_after_refactor to emit drift reports during bulk regeneration
