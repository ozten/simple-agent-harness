## Session: Implement polling and cross-project aggregation (simple-agent-harness-rxsx)

### Completed
- Bead simple-agent-harness-rxsx: Implement polling and cross-project aggregation
- Created blacksmith-ui/src/poller.rs with:
  - PollDataStore: per-instance polled data keyed by normalized URL
  - Aggregate struct: total_beads_open, total_beads_in_progress, total_cost_today, worker_utilization, instances_online/total
  - spawn_poller(): main polling loop that polls all instances concurrently at configurable interval
  - Per-instance polling: /api/health every poll, /api/status every poll, /api/beads every poll, /api/metrics/summary every poll, /api/project once on discovery, /api/improvements every 30s
  - Graceful degradation: 404s and errors return None, offline instances preserve last known state
  - Cross-project aggregate computation from beads + metrics data, with fallback to heartbeat worker counts
- Modified blacksmith-ui/src/discovery.rs:
  - Added set_online_status() method to InstanceRegistry for poller to update online/offline state
- Modified blacksmith-ui/src/main.rs:
  - Added poller module, PollStore in AppState
  - Spawns poller loop on startup with configurable poll interval
  - New endpoints: GET /api/aggregate (cross-project aggregates), GET /api/instances/:url/poll-data (per-instance polled data)
- All 1080 existing tests pass, zero clippy warnings, fmt clean
- Poll interval configurable via blacksmith-ui.toml dashboard.poll_interval_secs (default 10s)

### Current State
- Codebase is clean: tests pass, clippy clean, fmt clean
- Polling system is fully operational with graceful offline handling
- Polled endpoints that don't yet exist on serve instances (status, beads, metrics, project, improvements) return None gracefully

### Suggested Next Tasks
- simple-agent-harness-g7hg: Scaffold embedded frontend with project list sidebar (P1, now unblocked by this bead)
- simple-agent-harness-fsnv: Implement serve port auto-allocation (P2, ready)
- simple-agent-harness-xi2k: Add estimate API endpoint (P2, ready)
