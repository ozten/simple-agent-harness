## Session 174: No work available, queue empty

### Status
- Ready queue is empty (0 open beads)
- All 195 beads closed
- Codebase is clean: all tests pass, zero clippy warnings, formatting clean

### Suggested Next Tasks
- File new beads from a V4 spec or new requirements if available
- Consider performance profiling or integration testing
- The singleton lock issue (MEMORY.md) may still need addressing
